<p id="addr">
<span class="faqq">Bitcoin Addresses and Keys</span>
</p><p>
A bitcoin address is a number mathematically calculated from a 
private key irreversibly (the 
private key can not be determined from the address).
</p><p>
Addresses
provide "locations" for the storage of bitcoins, and
coins are typically sent from one address to another.  When 
coins are sent, the sender is required to prove 
ownership of the coins
by signing them using the private key of the 
address where they are stored.  
The signature proves the correct
private key was used without revealing it.
</p><p>
A private key must be memorized or stored securely. 
If a private key is lost,
coins stored at the associated address can never be spent.
</p><p>
In technical terms, a bitcoin address is an abbreviation 
(hash) of the public key 
part of an <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/ECDSA">ECDSA key pair</a>.  
</p>

<p id="pass">
<span class="faqq">Passphrases</span>
</p><p>
Many bitcoin clients allow 
a passphrase to be used as a private key.  
When a passphrase is used, nothing needs to be written down or stored,
but a carelessly devised passphrase is not secure.
<!--
</p><p>
One method often used to compose passphrases
is to replace letters
with numbers and special characters, for example
<span class="tt">
"heavy is the head that wears a crown"</span>
might become 
<span class="tt">
"h3^vy |s $h3 h3^d $h^$ w3^rs ^ cr.wn"</span>. 
-->
</p><p>
A passphrase composed in normal 
language generally should include at least 20 
words, although fewer words can be used if the phrase is random
and the size of the dictionary is large.  Nonsense
(dada) phrases can be secure.
Absurd poems and short stories can also be composed.
Passages from published works are
sometimes used, but only if many of the words 
are replaced, swapped, and/or combined.
<!--For example, the passages
<span class="tt">
"suffer the slings and arrows of outragous fortune"</span>
and <span class="tt">
"heavy is the head that wears a crown"</span>
might be combined to produce 
<span class="tt">
"suffer is slings head arrows wears outragous crown"</span>.
-->
</p><p>
A strong passphrase can also be extracted from a printed work using
various geometric sampling techniques, such as
copying characters vertically from a particular page and column
(the page and column chosen would be based on numbers that 
are easy for the user to remember but not public).
Different printed editions of a work would likely produce 
different passphrases.  An e-book or other digital text can be 
printed using unusual font faces and sizes to produce a 
source text to sample, provided that the printed text can be
reproduced exactly whenever the key is needed.
</p><p>
A series of passphrases can be produced by
generating a random key and attaching various words to it.
The
random key would be written down and secured and the attachments
would be memorized, i.e., 
<span class="tt">
"5J396V1kf8Z7ffWKQZpJYzWSNzKFhcuK5PLKP9ZdNLunzPL8NYS"</span>
might be used to form 
<span class="tt">
"5J396V1kf8Z7ffWKQZpJYzWSNzKFhcuK5PLKP9ZdNLunzPL8NYS zebra"</span>
and <span class="tt">
"5J396V1kf8Z7ffWKQZpJYzWSNzKFhcuK5PLKP9ZdNLunzPL8NYS rabbit"</span>
</p>


<p id="brain">
<span class="faqq">Brain wallets</span>
</p><p>
Many bitcoin users 
prefer to memorize or write
down private keys rather than digitally store them
to prevent their theft by hacking.
</p><p>
A "brain wallet" is a bitcoin client that does not store private keys
on any device or server.  Typically, brainwallets allow 
passphrases to be used as private keys.
</p><p>
Note that private keys/passphrases can still be vulnerable
on any device infected with keyboard-logging or similar malware, because
eventually the private key must be input to sign transactions.  
To reduce this risk,
a brain wallet can be used on a dark box.
</p>


<p id="darkbox">
<span class="faqq">Using a Dark Box to enhance security</span>
</p><p>
Since an internet connection provides a conduit for malware infections and other attacks that can undermine the security of installed software, 
experts often recommend using a quarantined device ("dark box") to perform 
critical security functions, such as those that generate 
keys for cryptography or use the keys to encrypt or sign data.
</p><p>
A bitcoin client that allows wallet
data and new transactions to be imported and exported to files 
can be run on a dark box.  A thumb drive or SD card can be used
to physically move downloaded wallet (transaction history) data 
to the quarantined device, 
and also to move signed transactions back to a
net-connected device to be broadcast to the bitcoin network.
In this way, private keys/passphrases need never be revealed to
any device with an internet connection, and the client and
underlying encryption
software is also not exposed to potentially corrupting attacks.
</p><p>
Since malicious code can be inserted into many types of files,
data moved between quarantined and net-connected devices should
be in plain text form, and only the most basic of text editors
should be used to open and save it.  
In addition, if a device to be quarantined 
was ever connected to the internet it is recommended that its
system be wiped and re-installed.
</p>


<p id="multisig">
<span class="faqq">Transactions</span>
</p><p>
A simple bitcoin transaction specifies
a bundle of stored coins 
("input") and a destination 
address ("output"). 
A complex transaction
can contain many inputs and outputs.
The difference between the value of the inputs and outputs 
is typically refunded to the owner
as change in an additional output.
</p><p>
Each transaction input references an output of
a previous transaction.  The inputs of the previous
transaction in turn reference outputs of older transactions, and so on.
Transactions and thier associations form the "public ledger",
which is crucially used by the bitcoin network
to prevent coins from being spent more than once.
</p>

<p id="multisigout">
<span class="faqq">Multi-Signature Transactions</span>
</p><p>
Multi-signature transaction outputs require proof of
M keys (signatures) of N 
addresses to spend the coins.
In the bitcoin protocol, 
the public key (the long form of the bitcoin address) is used to 
identify each N (endorser).
</p><p>
Multisig outputs can be used to enforce several types of contracts.  
A simple example is a couple, Alice and Bob,
who wish to have joint
control of a coin hoard, where both would have to agree to 
spend any of it.  The coins would be sent to a 2 of 2 multisig 
output specifying
both Alice and Bob as endorsers (presumably Alice and Bob would
not reveal thier private keys to each other).
</p><p>
Possessing M keys suffices to claim a multisig 
output, so it
is possible to create outputs that different people can validly
spend, setting up a race condition for the coins.
</p><p>
The bitcoin reference client currently enforces a limit 
of N=3, but the underlying protocol supports N <= 16.
</p>

<p id="multisig_escrow">
<span class="faqq">Using Multisig for Escrow Contracts</span>
</p><p>
A common use of multisig is to enforce escrow contracts,
which involve payments that finalize once specified conditions 
are satisfied. 
A common escrow contract requires 2 of 3 signatures
for redemption, where the three participants are the payer, 
the conditional recipient, and  
a dispute-resolution agent.
</p><p>
As an example, consider Mary who hires Bob to build a barn on her 
ranch, agreeing to pay Bob 300 BTC opun completion of the 
work.  Alice will mediate any dispute 
that may arise.  Mary sends a bitcoin transaction 
containing a multisig output specifying herself,
Bob, and Alice as endorsers.
</p><p>
<i>Scenario 1:</i> Bob completes the work as expected.  
Mary and Bob sign the output payable to Bob.
</p><p>
<i>Scenario 2:</i> Bob never shows up to do the work.  
Mary contacts Alice.
Mary and Alice sign the output payable to Mary. 
</p><p>
<i>Scenario 3:</i> Bob completes the work but Mary ignores his
requests for payment.   Bob contacts Alice.  
Bob and Alice sign the output payable to Bob.
</p><p>
<i>Scenario 4:</i> Bob finishes the work but Mary considers the job 
incomplete according to her specifications.   Bob refuses to
perform the additional work and contacts Alice.
Alice mediates and all eventually agree that Bob should receive two-thirds.
Mary and Alice sign the output payable to Alice, who then
sends 200 BTC to Bob and 100 BTC to Mary.
</p>

<p>
<span class="faqq">Using Multisig for Secure Backups</span>
</p><p>
A multisig transaction output requiring one of two
signatures for redemption (M=1 of N=2) can be used to insure against
the loss of a stored coin hoard in the event a key is destroyed or
passphrase is forgotten.  In such cases, the backup key could be
retrieved (from a safe-deposit, for example) and used to recover the
coins.

<p id="poem">
<span class="faqq">Q.</span> What is a "crypto-poem"?
</p><p>
A crypto-poem is a sequence of randomly generated words that
can be used as a strong private key.  Since a word sequence can be
memorized by a human without much difficulty, there is no need to 
write down or store the key. 
To remember a poem, imagine how the 
words might be used in a story.
